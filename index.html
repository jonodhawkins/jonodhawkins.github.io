    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img data-src="/assets/img/profile.png" class="uk-align-right" width="96px" alt="Image" uk-img>
    <p>
      I graduated from the University of Bristol in 2018 with a MEng in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. Throughout my time at Bristol, I began to look for opportunities to link my passion for the outdoors with Electronics, which has led me to be interested in electronic techniques for monitoring extreme environments.

    </p>
    <p>
      I am interested in how glaciers can be effectively monitored or explored using electronics, whether this is generating large-swath profiles of basal melt rates or investigating englacial and subglacial hydrology and its relation to increasing melt and flow rates. At UCL, I am building on the existing ApRES platform to enable it to perform autonomously across large areas and at greater depths.

      Hopefully there's something on here to take your interest, and please don't hesitate to get in touch should you have any questions.
