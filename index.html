          I graduated from the University of Bristol in 2018 with a MEng in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. Throughout my time at Bristol, I began to look for opportunities to link my passion for the outdoors with Electronics, which has led me to be interested in electronic techniques for monitoring extreme environments.

          I am interested in how glaciers can be effectively monitored or explored using electronics, whether this is generating large-swath profiles of basal melt rates or investigating englacial and subglacial hydrology and its relation to increasing melt and flow rates. At UCL, I am building on the existing ApRES platform to enable it to perform autonomously across large areas and at greater depths.
