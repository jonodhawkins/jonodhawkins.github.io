I'm writing this before my eyelids fall off, having left London at 6am yesterday morning, 16th November 2021, to travel to Cape Town.  One of the 'gateways' to Antarctica, I'm here with the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) and colleagues from the University of T&uuml;ebingen to undertake geophysical surveys on the Ekstr&ouml;m Ice Shelf.

The quarantine in Cape Town is mandatory, agreed by the Council of Managers of Antarctic Programmes to minimise the risk of Coronavirus entering the continent, where options for medical support and evacuations are limited.  It comprises of seven days in room 'total' isolation, followed by a further week of 'managed isolation' where mealtimes are shared and meetings are possible.  In spite of this, as we were registered and assigned rooms there was a change to mingle, have a coffee after the 24 hours of sleepless travel and break the ice with our new colleagues.

That said, the rooms provided by AWI and the view across to Robben Island to the west and the centre of Cape Town to the south is stunning.  High winds brought through an interspersed mix of rain showers and sunshine making it hard to tire of looking out of the window or taking in some fresh, sea air on the balcony to the soundtrack of some of South Africa's best surf.  Rumour has it that a kite-surfing competition is due to start later this week, which makes me wonder how much more crowed the bay can get without surfers becoming entangled.
