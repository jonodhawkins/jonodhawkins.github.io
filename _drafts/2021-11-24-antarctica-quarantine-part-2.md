## Day 18 / Saturday
- Pack up kit bag of electronics in case of potential for this to be shipped on to Neumayer without me.  Taking photos of kit and packing in case.

## Day 21 / Tuesday 
- Data back from Reza at Neumayer for initial surveying.  Time spent on mathematics night before sent in meeting to Susanne (Reinhard student) discussing zero-padding of FMCW signal.

## Day 22 / Wednesday
- News of 5 more infections within group.  Read email after watching PMQs of Johnson defending No. 10 party and angered by it - news of email hit pretty hard and threw productivity and mood for rest of the day.  Good to talk to Reinhard and Inka for reassurance.  UK moving to "plan B" and worry for Faye ending up in lockdown alone so plan for her to head home.  Now at peace with idea tomorrow's PCR can be positive and that will spell end of expedition.

## Day 24 / Friday
- Yesterday nervous before PCR, nervous beforehand but calm afterwards despite apparently logical contradiction of this.  Yesterday and today some work on writing thesis, and yesterday writing function to split ApRES `*.dat` files into separate files for each antenna pair.  Today PCR results all negative except for one new positive case.  Foggy all day with poor views but brilliant sunset.  Back and forth emailing with Reza and Olaf at Neumayer to solve issues with MIMO ApRES in unattended mode.  Create document/protocol for HF antenna measurements at Neummayer in case of no travel but equipment able to go ahead.

## Day 25 / Saturday
- After all negative results, today's main event was the fire alarm that went off in the morning while meeting on Zoom.  I got as far as the stairwell but didn't make it outside.  When we got back to our rooms, we found none of our keycards worked as they had been invalidated by our extended hotel stay.  Eventually made it back into room and uncertainty for rest of day about what this means r.e. quarantine.

## Day 30 / Thursday
- Meeting in evening with Reinhard and Inka to discuss how traverse may be altered and a longer stay possible to allow enough time for science objectives, but with a reduced ReMeltRadar team of Inka, Reza and myself with Olaf and Reinhard heading back from Neumayer to Germany.

## Day 31 / Friday
- Meetings throughout the day with Reinhard and Inka, Eberhard and the rest of the quarantine gruop and with Lai Bun to discuss options about extended time in field and consequences for EuMW conference.  Grammatical mistake in information sent prior to meeting with the quarantine group led to some confusion about whether those who left their rooms during the fire alarm would not longer be able to travel South.  Attended radar group seminar in the afternoon and enjoyed the monster burger again for dinner.

## Day 32 / Saturday
- Another rollercoaster of a week in quarantine at Blauuwberg Beach Hotel.  More negative tests, fire alarms and invalid key cards, cancelled flights and plans changing every other day.  Lots of highs and lows throughout the week but spent a very evening talking on the balcony with neighbour followed by an online virtual puzzle and relaxed chat with Reinhard and Inka.  Nice way to decompress after a very uncertain and changing week.

## Day 35 / Tuesday
It is a never ending cycle of news - good and bad.  This morning brought the frustrating news that, after we had finished our additional 14 days of quarantine, the weather continues to be bad at Neumayer and there a further five positive Covid cases identified within the quarantine group.  This led to a tricky meeting and it was decided those tested positive would have another test today to rule our false positives.  This was particularly tough news for those who were already due to fly back to Germany soon, as it could mean that they would face up to another two weeks of quarantine to abide by South African law.

## Day 37 / Wednesday
Fortunately the positive tests yesterday have since come back as negative, after being retested at a separate laboratory.  This has changed our policy that now we will no longer be tested until the flight.  After over a month in quarantine, the stress had begun to reach a point where it was difficult to contain much further with the seemingly indefinite prospect of quarantine ahead.  I spoke to my parents and Lai Bun in the afternoon to explain the situation but was otherwise very distracted.  When news came out of Neumayer that there was an issue with the ApRES HTTP interface to the ApRES, it wasn't good news but did provide an objective to focus my mind on which was welcome and I spoke with Reza until late into the evening trying to find a solution.

## Day 38 / Friday (Christmas Eve)
By today, the mood had settled a bit with acceptance of further delays and there is a promise of clearing weather at Neumayer and Wolf's Fang.  A meeting with Eberhard in the afternoon confirmed that the flight on the 26th was cancelled but that there was a window opening up later on.   I took things more slowly in the afternoon with some time to 'veg out' and it was a much needed break. 

## Day 39 / Saturday (Christmas Day)
Although I was expecting a relatively normal day, having selected from our now almost memorised menu the day before, we were surprised with a roast lunch, cracker, gingerbread man and a bottle of wine.  The hotel put on a singer in the courtyard outside just before lunch which was entertaining - not least because she seemed to think we were heading to Alaska.  At this point, it wouldn't surprise any of us if we ended up there.  I briefly spoke with my family, who were visiting my Ganny.  It was lovely to speak to them, but decked out in masks for their Christmas visit it was a reminder that Covid is still out there and presents a real risk to many - so the quarantine is not in vain.  After lunch, at 2pm, those of us still here showed off our festive hats - it was lovely to see everyone get involved and there were some awesome creations given our limited resources of hotel food boxes and loo rolls... After this, the James Webb Space Telescope launch was being livestreamed which we watched in awe.  I spoke with Faye in the afternoon and unwrapped her Christmas gift and later in the evening spoke with Alasdair, Ash and Adam.

## Day 40 / Sunday (Boxing Day)
