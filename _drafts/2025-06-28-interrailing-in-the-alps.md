Travel by train from UK to Brig, Switzerland.

Heatwave in UK and Europe.

Journey:
- London St Pancras to Brussels
- Brussels to K&ouml;ln
- K&ouml;ln to Mannheim
- Mannheim to Basel Sbb
- Basel Sbb to Brig

Arriving in Brig late into the evening to a lively square - surprising!

## 2025-06-29 Sunday
Slow morning to recover from the previous day's sitting around.

Headed to the main SBB station at Brig to deposit our bags in the storage lockers.

Bought some lunch and boarded a train to M&ouml;rel, from where we took a train to Reideralp.

Helped in the cable car station by the lift operator who after some persuasion let me use his screwdriver to fix my sunglasses.

The Aletsch half marathon ran through Reideralp and along the route we were using to see the Aletsch glacier itself.  We walked alongside the runners until stopping under the canopy of a closer chairlift for some respite from the blazing sun while we at our lunch.

Returning to M&ouml;rel for the train, we chatted with one of the race participants who recommended we revisit the area in winter for some skiing. Caught up in the chat, I left my camera on the seat and - upon realising at the train station - ran back to the telecabine to see if it could be found at the upper station. 

Fortunately the attendant had already found the camera and sent it down quickly.

Took the bus back to Brig, and then boarded the 511 bus to Saas-Fee and checked into our apartment.

The weather forecast for the week wasn't inspiring, with thunderstorms predicted almost every day.

With the arrival of our [SaastalCard]() in our inbox, we set out on a walk from the Hannig lift and along the walls of the valley towards the Gletschersee.

Crossed the Triftbach river and walked upstream slightly to a snow patch which had a magnificent tunnel carved through the centre.

We attracted the attention of a sheep who looked to be protecting its lambs. It called for backup and we backed off as the entire flock bleated their way towards us.

We wound our way down to Gletschersee and then took the Felskinn cable car to up to 3000m to enjoy the view across the Feegletscher.

It was time for a late lunch when we arrived back in Saas-Fee. Afterwards, we headed to the tourist information centre to get a better understanding of the access to the various via ferrata in the valley and what was open.

While sitting on the balcony in the afternoon, awaiting the imminent thunderstorm, we jumped up excitedly at the sound of a clap of thunder. 
However, quickly we realised instead this was a huge rockfall on the north-west face of the Mittaghorn, which filled the valley with dust.

Early night, ready to tackle the Jeginhorn via ferrata the following day.

## 2025-07-01 Tuesday
The Jeginhorn via ferrata is billed online as the "highest via in the Western Alps".

We left our apartment to catch the `7:30` bus to Saas-Grund. Bought a baguette from a bakery and then headed up the Honsaas cable car to start the walk up to beginning of the route.

Following a deserted and sorry-looking summer ski run, we took a left-hand fork and passed several natural springs before finding ourselves at the base of the via ferrata.

The beginning consists of the sections of rocky scrambling with the occasional peg or hook for assistance.

At about half height, the first ladder is encountered which gives way to slightly gentler terrain before another series of ladders.

After reaching the subsidiary summit, at the end of a long ridge which stretches down from the Fletschorn, you can choose to take the easier route (K-3) which traverses the col to the summit of the Jeginhorn, or the impressive suspension bridge and steeper route that follows (K-4/5).

Paused briefly at the summit for some biscuits, signed the book and photos before heading down the scree covered descent.
This petered out eventually into a more gentle descent and at the fork in the path back to the Wiessmieshutte we stopped for lunch.

Faye twisted her ankle on the path back to Kreuzboden.  Hopefully dipping our feet in the lake did some good - but hard to keep in for any significant time thanks to the cold of the alpine water.

Took the upper cablecar to see the view from Hohsass. Admired the glacier and eyed up potential routes to revisit in the future.
