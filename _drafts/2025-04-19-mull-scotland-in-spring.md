## Ready, set, Kendal
<span class="weekday">Friday / 2025-04-18</span>

R&S arrive in Kendal to stay overnight
Z&M staying in Kirby Lonsdale

## Onward to Oban
<span class="weekday">Saturday / 2025-04-19</span>

In order to balance the baggage between the Rory and Zo&euml;'s trusty Citro&euml;n C1s, I was in a car with Rory and Si&acirc;n, and Faye was with Zo&euml; and Meg.
With what felt like plenty of time for our ferry sailing at `17:15`, we left Kendal at `08:30` sharp.
Four hours drive from Oban, We didn't meet each other en route or stop for lunch and instead arrived into Oban hungry.
I had been extoling the virtues of the [Green Shack](https://www.visitscotland.com/info/food-drink/the-green-shack-p980981) from when Faye and I had visited on our [last trip]({% post_url 2023-06-16-inner-hebrides-cycling %}) to Oban.
Unfortunately, the queue stretched down the harbourside and our stomachs couldn't wait.

Overlooking the harbour with a mediocre mozarella, tomato and basil panini, we ate lunch, which I had to top up wtih a portion of chips from one of the many fish and chip shops.
Perhaps having spent a bit too long eating, we made our way to the supermarkets, divided the shopping list between the six of us and got to work finding a weeks worth of breakfast, lunch and dinner supplies.
The boarding time for the ferry came around quickly and we were soon in the queue of cars to board the ferry (MV Loch Frisa).
We drove out of the ferry and north across Mull towards Dervaig to our home for the week.

Soon afterwards, Meg had whipped up a wild garlic pesto pasta dish for dinner which went down very well after a day of travelling.
We settled into the accommodation in the comfortably furnished lounge.
Hiding underneath the coffee table - to my excitement - was a wooden train set which beckoned "what is the highest ramp you could make with this train set?".
The evening's entertainment (for me and Rory at least) was sorted and we made a vague plan to go for a short walk along the Treshnish coast the following day.

## Nice to see you, to see you Treshnish
<span class="weekday">Sunday / 2025-04-20</span>

Testing the prowess of the C1s' engines over the moor road, we made a stop en route at the "The Black Beach".
Parking in a lay-by near the Allt na Cille, we headed down towards the beach and walked into a field scattered with ultimate frisbee goals.
These make convincing cattle feeders and for a seemingly out of the way field full of Highland cows, I'm still not really sure which these purposes they were intended for.
At the side of a stream, there was a rope swing hanging from a tree - everyone had a turn and it was strong enough for two of us at one, with a little added difficulty while dismounting.
The overcast sky felt heavy over the "Black Beach" which cast a dull and serious light across the strait that separates Ulva from Mull.

{% include photo.html src="/assets/img/2025-04-19/cows.jpg" alt="Highland cows waiting for the sun on Black Beach, near Kilkinian." %}

We made our way back up to the Citro%euml;ns and continued along the coastal road.
As I called out from the passenger seat, we made an abrupt stop and in the sky on the horizon was an eagle being mobbed by a murder of crows.
We watched the eagle swerve and dive to avoid the defensive swoops of the crows, until it settled into the heather on a prominent section of cliff.
In the car behind us, Zoe, Meg, Sian and Faye stopped briefly and then drove further along the road to have a look for themselves.

Further down the road, we parked at the [Tin Shed Gallery](http://www.tinshedgallery.co.uk/) and had a poke through the door, with Faye and Sian immediately identifying plenty of the 'tiny things' (and wonderful artwork) on offer inside.
Along the track, we passed the old township of [Clac Gugairidh](https://www.trove.scot/place/21799) which has been in a state of disrepair since the 1870s when Ordnance Survey surveyed the area.
At the foot of the track, we came across a group warning us of an adder further along the path which now hugged the coastline.
It was beginning to approach lunchtime and we stopped underneath a small crag to have the first round of our cheese and pickle sandwiches for the week.

{% include photo.html src="/assets/img/2025-04-19/lunch-treshnish.jpg" alt="Sandwiches and smiles underneath the crags of the Treshnish coast." %}

After we had refuelled, scrambled on the crag and watched a [Wheatear](https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/wheatear) flit across the top of the cliffs below us, we coontinued to walk along the coastal path.
Eventually, the path brought us back inland along a small farm track which joined up with the coastal road.
We followed this back to the the cars and continued down the coastal road to stop for a swim at the magnificent Calgary Bay.
The water was fresh (read: freezing!) and it took some time to become accustomed to the temperature - tricky in what is quite a shallow bay.
It was my turn to cook dinner that evening - on the menu was a lentil chilli, which Faye had been asking me to cook for the last week.

## Never mind the rain, it's geomorphology time
<span class="weekday">Monday / 2025-04-21</span>

The forecast for Monday was rain, so we planned a driving tour of Mull so that we could escape the worst of the weather.
On the way to our first stop, I suggested we pull over to the side of the road to have a look at a ruined Broch which I had spotted on the map. 
By chance, this happened to be down the road from the [Lip na Cloiche](http://www.lipnacloiche.co.uk/) gardens.
We parked up both cars and toured the impressive gardens which are well worth a visit.

{% include photo.html src="/assets/img/2025-04-19/gardens.jpg" alt="The impressive gardens at Lip na Cloiche." %}

The next (and originally first) stop on our tour was the Eas Fors waterfall.
The falls are impressive, despite our not taking the time to appreciate the extent to which they flow into the loch below. 
Instead, we walked above the main waterfall at the roadside and while Si&acirc;n and Meg swam, the rest of us watched an eagle overhead and skimmed stones long one of the flats.
As the rain began to set in, we jumped back in the cars and continued along the coastal road to the car park Killechronan where we met up for a weather-induced car-based picnic.

To the excitement of the glaciologists in the group (who will remain nameless), the next location on the itinerary introduced some much needed glacial geomorphology into the day.
For some reason, traipsing across the basalt shores of Loch na Keal in the rain looking for slightly different bits of rock didn't appeal to the wider group, but eventually we found some of the best examples of [p-forms](/assets/files/2025-04-19/p-forms.pdf) on the British Isles!

{% include photo.html src="/assets/img/2025-04-19/p-forms.jpg" alt="Anonymous glaciologist excited at finding p-forms." %}

Winding along the shores of Loch na Keal was a highlight from our Inner Hebrides cycle two years before. Despite the rain, the coastal road still impressed as we drove towards Balevuin, tucked between the cliffs and lapping waters of the loch.
We ended up stuck behind a herd of heavily pregnant cows as we drove down the other side of the pass - only building anticipation of whether we might see an eagle in its nest in the hills above the road.
Karma came out in our favour to make up for the rainy weather and indeed, sitting amongst swaying pines, was a white-tailed eagle.

{% include photo.html src="/assets/img/2025-04-19/pregnant-cows.gif" alt="In a traffic jam of pregnant cows." %}

Originally, we had planned to drive on to Lochbuie to see the standing stones, with the possibility of some of us running there from the Three Lochs Viewpoint in Glen More.
However, by this point, the rain had really begun to set in and time was getting on.
Meg and Zo&euml; headed back to the accommodation, while Rory, Si&acirc;n, Faye and I continued on for a brief detour via Duart Castle, before joining them.
By the time the four of us had made it back to Dervaig, Helen and Lucy had also arrived. 
To round off the day, Rory and Si&acirc;n made a delicious vegetable traybake and we fixed our plans for the following day.

## Island hopping
<span class="weekday">Tuesday / 2025-04-22</span>

It was Helen's birthday, and to celebrate we had booked a boat trip around Staffa - a volcanically formed island off the western coast of Mull.
While there were renovation works underway on the jetty it was not possible to land the boat at Staffa, so the tour would instead involve circumnavigating the island instead.
We drove from Dervaig down to Ulva Ferry, the namesake of the short connecting boat ride from Mull to Ulva, for a 10:00 departure for Staffa.

{% include photo.html src="/assets/img/2025-04-19/ulva-columns.jpg" alt="Basalt columns on Ulva, foreshadowing those we would soon see on Staffa." %}

As we left Ulva Ferry and rounded the south west corner of Ulva, through Loch na Keal and out into the Irish sea, we passed an extraordinary set of basalt columns, which foreshadowed those we were soon to see on Staffa.
On the hour long journey, we were spoiled for views of the western coastline of Mull, Eagles and an assortment of sea birds.
We soon rounded the headland and were presented with the classic view of Fingal's cave.
Out of the shelter of Staffa, we were exposed to the force of the wind coming across the sea and watched as huge waves crashed into the opposing basalt cliffs.

{% include photo.html src="/assets/img/2025-04-19/staffa.jpg" alt="The infamous view of Fingal's cave, Staffa." %}

We passed back by the rafts of puffins that rested in the sheltered water to the east of the island and began our journey back to Ulva Ferry.
Pairs of gannets and gulls flew past the boat and gray seals appeared fleetingly in the distance.
The first land we neared on our right hand side was the island of Goemtra, a private island owned by the environmental campaigner Roc Sandford.
His [website](https://gometry.org) for the island, and in particular the history section gives a taste of the eccentricity of someone who buys their own island.

{% include photo.html src="/assets/img/2025-04-19/puffin.jpg" alt="Surfing puffin on the coast of Staffa." %}

On our return to Ulva Ferry, we took the ferry itself across to Ulva and ate lunch and Helen's birthday cake on the quayside.
For the next few hours, we ambled about the island and enjoyed the views across the sea back towards Mull.
When we returned to the quay, we stopped for a drink in the newly opened [Boathouse](https://www.theboathouseulva.com/) which had been serving delicious looking seafood at lunchtime.
We crossed the ferry once again and made our way back to Dervaig, via Calgary bay for another quick swim.

## Faye's fish and chip review
<span class="weekday">Wednesday / 2025-04-23</span>

Far across the Isle of Mull, at the very end of the Ross of Mull lies the holy island of Iona.
We made the nearly two hour drive for Ffionport where, after catching up with everyone and having a quick spot of lunch, a brief ferry trip took us across to Iona.
The promise of dolphins on the crossing wasn't realised, however we couldn't have asked for more glorious weather as the CalMac ferry dropped us off.
After we had visited a small gift shop (of small things), the next stop along the main road on the island was the ruined nunnery, followed by the abbey itself.

{% include photo.html src="/assets/img/2025-04-19/ffionport-to-iona.jpg" alt="The gang on Ulva." %}

While Helen and Lucy continued on to Tr&agrave;igh Bh&agrave;n (White Beach), the rest of us took a tour of the abbey.
It dates back to 563 when it was founded by St Colunba and twelve companions, starting off as a settlement of primitive lodging and eventually expanding into the impressive buildings and grounds which make up the abbey today.
As we wandered around the grounds and followed the audio tour, there was a wedding taking place for a couple who had met volunteering as members of the [Iona Community](https://iona.org.uk/).

Eventually, we joined Helen and Lucy and the beach and under the auspices of an Ionan blue sky we took a dip in the 'refreshingly cool' and beautifully clear sea.
The beach had amazing views back over to Mull and we were able to make out the outline of the [Fossil Tree](https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/mull/fossil-tree.shtml) in the distance - something we saved to see on another visit.
After drying off, we tramped back to Baile Mor to catch the penultimate ferry of the day to Ffionport.

{% include photo.html src="/assets/img/2025-04-19/iona-traigh-bhan.jpg" alt="Looking across from Tr&agrave;igh Bh&agrave;n to the Ardmeanach peninsula." %}

For the whole week, Faye had raved about the fish and chip shop on the pier.
Finally able to make her own review ("fresh fish with tasty herb flecked batter, left wanting by the chips", you read it here first), we tucked in to our dinner as the sun began to lower in the sky over Iona.
As the sun began to cast a softer and softer red light across the bay, Rory, Si&acirc;n, Faye and I stayed on to sample some of the bouldering on the beach in Ffionport .
Zo&euml;, Meg, Helen and Lucy drove back to the accommodation and were treated on their way back to the sight of a group of otters swimming on the shore of Loch Na Keal.
Despite their warnings, we had no such luck by the time we made it to the same spot, instead only managing to scare a flight of woodcock into the looming dusk.

## If only there was Beinn Mh&ograve;r
<span class="weekday">Thursday / 2025-04-24</span>

With the promise of the best weather for the week, Thursday had been designated the day that we would tackle the lonely Munro of Beinn Mh&ograve;r (Ben More).
There are only a handful of popular routes to the summit of Mull's sole mountain over 3000 feet: a tried and tested 'tourist track' which follows the northerly slopes to the summit, and the more scrambly horseshoe via Beinn Fhada and A'Chioch.
Lucy and Helen made a later start to follow the more straightforward route to the summit, while the remainder of us engaged the tried and tested tactic of shuttling the cars so we had a one strategically positioned at the start and end of our horseshoe route.

{% include photo.html src="/assets/img/2025-04-19/slopes-of-ben-more.jpg" alt="Happy faces on the steep ascent from Loch na Keal to Beinn Fhada." %}

We were quickly on step slopes as we started to wind our way up the grassy side of Beinn Fhada.
Despite the blue sky, there was still a stiff and cold breeze which nearly deprived us of Rory's sit mat as we sat down for a quick break.
After an hour or so, we reached the subsidiary ridge of Beinn Fhada and began to follow the undulating path towards its summit and further into the embrace of Beinn Mh&ograve;r's horseshoe.

On reaching the summit, we treated ourselves to lunch with a view as we looked back along Beinn Fhada to Loch Na Keal.
To our left, the summits of A'Chioch and Beinn Mh&ograve;r made sure to let us know that there was still plenty of ascent left in our day.
Perhaps reluctantly, we pulled ourselves to our feet and began the slightly descent down into the saddle below A'Chioch.
As we regained the meters in elevation that we had just let go of, we followed a slight scramble on the southern face of the hill to its summit.
We looked across to Beinn Mh&ograve;r and could make out the silhouettes of two figures at the summit cairn.
Despite grainy photo evidence, we couldn't clearly tell if this was indeed Helen and Lucy - they later confirmed it was.

{% include photo.html src="/assets/img/2025-04-19/scramble-a-chioch.jpg" alt="Scrambling up the eastern face of Beinn Mh&ograve;r to meet Helen and Lucy." credit="Helen Astle"%}

It took an additional descent into a saddle before we could start the Grade 1 scramble to our final summit of the day.
Despite our concerns from descriptions of the route online (unpleasant and loose), following the crest of the ridge closely gave way to a pleasant scrambling line that quickly gave way to the summit cairn.
Peering out from the stone walls were Helen and Lucy who had decided to wait for us to meet them.
After another brief rest, we started our way back down the track to the cars.
About halfway down, we veered off to the right of the track and found a beautiful pool tucked below a shallow waterfall.
It called out to us to go for a swim and in the glare of the sun and shelter from the wind, we obliged.

{% include photo.html src="/assets/img/2025-04-19/summit-ben-more.jpg" alt="Reunited on the summit of Beinn Mh&ograve;r."%}

Eventually, we found ourselves on the shores of Loch Na Keal again and divided ourselves into cars to head back to Dervaig.
With a brief detour via Tobermory to pick up some supplementary items for dinner and desert.
Helen and Lucy put together a delicious mackerel Kedgeree, and I cooked profiteroles for desert to round off the evening.
