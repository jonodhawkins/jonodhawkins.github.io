## 2025-04-19 Saturday
In order to balance the baggage between the Rory and Zo&euml;'s trusty Citro&euml;n C1s, I was in a car with Rory and Si&acirc;n, and Faye was with Zo&euml; and Meg.
With what felt like plenty of time for our ferry sailing at `17:15`, we left Kendal at `08:30` sharp.
Four hours drive from Oban, We didn't meet each other en route or stop for lunch and instead arrived into Oban hungry.
I had been extoling the virtues of the [Green Shack](https://www.visitscotland.com/info/food-drink/the-green-shack-p980981) from when Faye and I had visited on our [last trip]({% post_url 2023-06-16-inner-hebrides-cycling %}) to Oban.
Unfortunately, the queue stretched down the harbourside and our stomachs couldn't wait.

Overlooking the harbour with a mediocre mozarella, tomato and basil panini, we ate lunch, which I had to top up wtih a portion of chips from one of the many fish and chip shops.
Perhaps having spent a bit too long eating, we made our way to the supermarkets, divided the shopping list between the six of us and got to work finding a weeks worth of breakfast, lunch and dinner supplies.
The boarding time for the ferry came around quickly and we were soon in the queue of cars to board the ferry (MV Loch Frisa).
We drove out of the ferry and north across Mull towards Dervaig to our home for the week.

Soon afterwards, Meg had whipped up a wild garlic pesto pasta dish for dinner which went down very well after a day of travelling.
We settled into the accommodation in the comfortably furnished lounge.
Hiding underneath the coffee table - to my excitement - was a wooden train set which beckoned "what is the highest ramp you could make with this train set?".
The evening's entertainment (for me and Rory at least) was sorted and we made a vague plan to go for a short walk along the Treshnish coast the following day.

Testing the prowess of the C1s' engines over the moor road, we made a stop en route at the "The Black Beach".
Parking in a lay-by near the Allt na Cille, we headed down towards the beach and walked into a field scattered with ultimate frisbee goals.
These make convincing cattle feeders and for a seemingly out of the way field full of Highland cows, I'm still not really sure which these purposes they were intended for.
At the side of a stream, there was a rope swing hanging from a tree - everyone had a turn and it was strong enough for two of us at one, with a little added difficulty while dismounting.
The overcast sky felt heavy over the "Black Beach" which cast a dull and serious light across the strait that separates Ulva from Mull.

{% include photo.html src="/assets/img/2025-04-19/cows.jpg" alt="Highland cows waiting for the sun on Black Beach, near Kilkinian." %}

We made our way back up to the Citro%euml;ns and continued along the coastal road.
As I called out from the passenger seat, we made an abrupt stop and in the sky on the horizon was an eagle being mobbed by a murder of crows.
We watched the eagle swerve and dive to avoid the defensive swoops of the crows, until it settled into the heather on a prominent section of cliff.
In the car behind us, Zoe, Meg, Sian and Faye stopped briefly and then drove further along the road to have a look for themselves.

Further down the road, we parked at the [Tin Shed Gallery](http://www.tinshedgallery.co.uk/) and had a poke through the door, with Faye and Sian immediately identifying plenty of the 'tiny things' (and wonderful artwork) on offer inside.
Along the track, we passed the old township of [Clac Gugairidh](https://www.trove.scot/place/21799) which has been in a state of disrepair since the 1870s when Ordnance Survey surveyed the area.
At the foot of the track, we came across a group warning us of an adder further along the path which now hugged the coastline.
It was beginning to approach lunchtime and we stopped underneath a small crag to have the first round of our cheese and pickle sandwiches for the week.

{% include photo.html src="/assets/img/2025-04-19/lunch-treshnish.jpg" alt="Sandwiches and smiles underneath the crags of the Treshnish coast." %}

After we had refuelled, scrambled on the crag and watched a [Wheatear](https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/wheatear) flit across the top of the cliffs below us, we coontinued to walk along the coastal path.
Eventually, the path brought us back inland along a small farm track which joined up with the coastal road.
We followed this back to the the cars and continued down the coastal road to stop for a swim at the magnificent Calgary Bay.
The water was fresh (read: freezing!) and it took some time to become accustomed to the temperature - tricky in what is quite a shallow bay.
It was my turn to cook dinner that evening - on the menu was a lentil chilli, which Faye had been asking me to cook for the last week.

## 2025-04-21 Monday
The forecast for Monday was rain, so we planned a driving tour of Mull so that we could escape the worst of the weather.
On the way to our first stop, I suggested we pull over to the side of the road to have a look at a ruined Broch which I had spotted on the map. 
By chance, this happened to be down the road from the [Lip na Cloiche](http://www.lipnacloiche.co.uk/) gardens.
We parked up both cars and toured the impressive gardens which are well worth a visit.

{% include photo.html src="/assets/img/2025-04-19/gardens.jpg" alt="The impressive gardens at Lip na Cloiche." %}

The next (and originally first) stop on our tour was the Eas Fors waterfall.
The falls are impressive, despite our not taking the time to appreciate the extent to which they flow into the loch below. 
Instead, we walked above the main waterfall at the roadside and while Si&acirc;n and Meg swam, the rest of us watched an eagle overhead and skimmed stones long one of the flats.
As the rain began to set in, we jumped back in the cars and continued along the coastal road to the car park Killechronan where we met up for a weather-induced car-based picnic.

To the excitement of the glaciologists in the group (who will remain nameless), the next location on the itinerary introduced some much needed glacial geomorphology into the day.
For some reason, traipsing across the basalt shores of Loch na Keal in the rain looking for slightly different bits of rock didn't appeal to the wider group, but eventually we found some of the best examples of [p-forms](/assets/files/2025-04-19/p-forms.pdf) on the British Isles!

{% include photo.html src="/assets/img/2025-04-19/p-forms.jpg" alt="Anonymous glaciologist excited at finding p-forms." %}

Winding along the shores of Loch na Keal was a highlight from our Inner Hebrides cycle two years before. Despite the rain, the coastal road still impressed as we drove towards Balevuin, tucked between the cliffs and lapping waters of the loch.
We ended up stuck behind a herd of heavily pregnant cows as we drove down the other side of the pass - only building anticipation of whether we might see an eagle in its nest in the hills above the road.
Karma came out in our favour to make up for the rainy weather and indeed, sitting amongst swaying pines, was a white-tailed eagle.

{% include photo.html src="/assets/img/2025-04-19/pregnant-cows.gif" alt="In a traffic jam of pregnant cows." %}

Originally, we had planned to drive on to Lochbuie to see the standing stones, with the possibility of some of us running there from the Three Lochs Viewpoint in Glen More.
However, by this point, the rain had really begun to set in and time was getting on.
Meg and Zo&euml; headed back to the accommodation, while Rory, Si&acirc;n, Faye and I continued on for a brief detour via Duart Castle, before joining them.
By the time the four of us had made it back to Dervaig, Helen and Lucy had also arrived. 
To round off the day, Rory and Si&acirc;n made a delicious vegetable traybake and we fixed our plans for the following day.

## 2025-04-22 Tuesday
It was Helen's birthday, and to celebrate we had booked a boat trip around Staffa - a volcanically formed island off the western coast of Mull.
While there were renovation works underway on the jetty it was not possible to land the boat at Staffa, so the tour would instead involve circumnavigating the island instead.
We drove from Dervaig down to Ulva Ferry, the namesake of the short connecting boat ride from Mull to Ulva, for a 10:00 departure for Staffa.

{% include photo.html src="/assets/img/2025-04-19/ulva-columns.jpg" alt="Basalt columns on Ulva, foreshadowing those we would soon see on Staffa." %}

As we left Ulva Ferry and rounded the south west corner of Ulva, through Loch na Keal and out into the Irish sea, we passed an extraordinary set of basalt columns, which foreshadowed those we were soon to see on Staffa.
On the hour long journey, we were spoiled for views of the western coastline of Mull, Eagles and an assortment of sea birds.
We soon rounded the headland and were presented with the classic view of Fingal's cave.
Out of the shelter of Staffa, we were exposed to the force of the wind coming across the sea and watched as huge waves crashed into the opposing basalt cliffs.

{% include photo.html src="/assets/img/2025-04-19/staffa.jpg" alt="The infamous view of Fingal's cave, Staffa." %}

We passed back by the rafts of puffins that rested in the sheltered water to the east of the island and began our journey back to Ulva Ferry.
Pairs of gannets and gulls flew past the boat and gray seals appeared fleetingly in the distance.
The first land we neared on our right hand side was the island of Goemtra, a private island owned by the environmental campaigner Roc Sandford.
His [website](https://gometry.org) for the island, and in particular the history section gives a taste of the eccentricity of someone who buys their own island.

On our return to Ulva Ferry, we took the ferry itself across to Ulva and ate lunch and Helen's birthday cake on the quayside.
For the next few hours, we ambled about the island and enjoyed the views across the sea back towards Mull.
When we returned to the quay, we stopped for a drink in the newly opened [Boathouse](https://www.theboathouseulva.com/) which had been serving delicious looking seafood at lunchtime.
We crossed the ferry once again and made our way back to Dervaig, via Calgary bay for another quick swim.

## 2025-04-23 Wednesday
Far across the Isle of Mull, at the very end of the Ross of Mull lies the holy island of Iona.
We made the nearly two hour drive for Ffionport where, after catching up with everyone and having a quick spot of lunch, a brief ferry trip took us across to Iona.
The promise of dolphins on the crossing wasn't realised, however we couldn't have asked for more glorious weather as the CalMac ferry dropped us off.
After we had visited a small gift shop (of small things), the next stop along the main road on the island was the ruined nunnery, followed by the abbey itself.

{% include photo.html src="/assets/img/2025-04-19/ffionport-to-iona.jpg" alt="The gang on Ulva." %}

The abbey dates back to 563 when it was founded by St Colunba and twelve companions.
