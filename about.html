      I grew up in South East London, probably best known for its centre-screen appearance on the titles for Eastenders.  Family holidays to the Lake District and Snowdonia were an opporunity to relate to the post-glacial geography otherwise only seen in school textbooks, while playing with LEGO Mindstorms was probably my first delve into 'electronics'.

      After starting to climb at Mile End Climing Wall at the age of 11 and exploring the Southern Sandstone crags in Sussex, I was hooked.  Learning to trad climb at Stanage opened the door to the wider world of rock climbing in the UK and a place on the <a href="https://www.jcmt.org.uk/">Jonathan Conville Memorial Trust course</a> in Chamonix gave me a chance to try my hand at Alpine mountaineering in 2016.

      A return trip to the Mer-de-Glace glacier in 2017 was my first experience of seeing the extent of the glacier's retreat, after which I began to look into how I could turn my engineering studies towards glaciology.  At the RGS IBG Explore conference in November that year I attended the polar expeditions workshop and have been solving electronic engineering problems within glaciology since.

      Since 2018, I have been involved in scientific expeditions and field courses to Antarctica, Greenland, Svalbard and the European Alps which have been focussed on standard and experimental geophysics techniques, including novel sensor Design.

      I have experience with the design, development and testing of electronic instrumentation, specialising in radar and radio-frequency (RF) systems, for glaciological applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to developing instrumentation, I have experience of fieldwork in the Arctic and Antarctic with radar (GPR and ApRES), seismic (active and passive) and GNSS methods.
    </p>
    <h2 class="uk-heading-divider">HF ApRES</h2>
    <div class="uk-width-1-1 uk-height-small uk-margin-bottom uk-background-image uk-background-center-center uk-background-cover" data-src="/assets/img/wire-mesh-antenna.jpg" alt="" uk-img>
    </div>
    <p>
      The research question behind my PhD project at UCL is to explore the feasibility of a high-frequency (HF) version of the ApRES radar for use in synthetic aperture radar imagery.  The ApRES was developed in collaboration between University College London and the British Antarctic Survey as a VHF/UHF phase-sensitive radar to monitor basal melt-rates on ice sheets with millimeter precision [<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6905935">1</a>].
    </p>
    <p>
      The motivation behind reducing the operating bandwidth of the ApRES stems from the relationship between radar sample spacing and wavelength - the shorter the wavelength, the shorter the spacing.  A radar with a larger wavelength requires fewer samples to cover the same distance, at the cost of reduced vertical resolution.  Initial work has been developing and testing novel <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9206123">wire-mesh antennas</a>, suitable for deployment in polar and Alpine regions, development of the signal processing necessary to generate imagery of the basal interface of an ice shelf and the development of a two-dimensional simulation tool to enable forward modelling of the ApRES in various environments.

      I am part of the team behind <a href="https://www.cryoskills.com">Cryoskills</a>, a field course teaching engineering skills to early career researchers in the Cryosphere.  We ran the inaugural course in 2024 and will make the course materials available on the website.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have worked as a teaching assistant on the following laboratory courses in the Electronic & Electrical Engineering department at UCL.  This has included the development of course materials for students in addition to supporting the delivery of face-to-face and online sessions.
