      I've not always wanted to be an electronic engineer or even more tenuously a radioglaciologist, although it is perhaps easy to see how a LEGO childhood, trips to the post-glacial landscapes of the UK's national parks and skiing holidays in the Alps might have something to do with it.

      It wasn't until a second trip to the Mer-de-Glace glacier in Chamonix, seeing the extent of just one year's melt with my own eyes, that I really began to look for ways to shoehorn electronics and the Alpine world into a career path ahead of me.  The RGS IBG Explore conference later that year opened my eyes to the world of polar science and I was intruiged.

        Although I'm based in London and as far away from any hills the UK has to offer, I still enjoy getting out to Snowdonia, the Lake District and Scotland as often as I can.  As a teenager, trees in the local park because a vertical playground to learn how to ascend ropes, abseil and haul.
