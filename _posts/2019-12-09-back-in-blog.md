It's back! After a hiatus-and-a-half, I've finally gotten around to putting together my website.  While it remains in a work-in-progress, it is nice to have a platform again to put pictures, words and ideas into the world.  With any luck, I'll be able to use the blog to put up photos from weekend trips, my gripes with Git and MATLAB wrestling matches.

It's been a busy couple of months since coming back from the Rh&#244;ne Glacier and deploying the HF ApRES, but the photo above is of me on Kipling Groove from an unexpectedly sunny mini-break to Langdale in September with Faye.

See you soon,  
Jono
