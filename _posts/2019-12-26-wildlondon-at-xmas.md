I doubt it would be possible to convince anyone - myself included - of the idea of a truly 'Wild London', however the pockets of green are something to hold onto in a city that is becoming increasingly grey and vertical.  Below are some moments from the last few weeks taking out the kayak on the Regent's Canal, in Greenwich Park on Christmas Day and in my parent's suburban garden on the theme of a Wild London.

It has been fun to play around with my new circular polarising filter over the last couple of days and seems to make a marked difference to photo quality in strong sunlight.  Unfortunately, and as usual, the chance of a white Christmas and New Year (in Scotland at least) is looking thin but I'm excited nonetheless to spend a few days out of the big smoke on the Isle of Skye.
